<h1>Mini-Project 01: Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit Systems</h1>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This report analyzes data from the National Transit Database. The report explores some of the fiscal characteristics of major US public transportation systems, such as: farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source. One key metric to keep in mind is the farebox recovery ratio. Farebox recovery ratio represents the proportion of operating expenses that are covered just by fares alone. The ratio is total fares/total operating expenses for said time frame. This ratio becomes important as we explore various cities, their agencies for public transportation, and their different modes of public transportation and look for the most efficient and profitable form.</p>
<section id="data-preprocessing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>This study uses three primary datasets: 2022 Fare Revenue, 2022 Operating Expenses, and the latest Monthly Ridership data. A note to keep in mind: because the data is reported on a lag, the 2022 version of each report was used.</p>
<p>As you will find in the code below, the three datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged. The fare revenue data was filtered to include only relevant columns and aggregated by the columns NTD ID, Agency Name and Mode. The expenses data was similarly filtered then aggregated by NTD ID and Mode. These two datasets were then merged into a single table titled FINANCIALS.</p>
<p>The monthly ridership data was handled separately. The Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) data was extracted and combined into new table titled USAGE. This later allows for an easy calculation of farebox recovery and views of the highest/lowest VRM and UPT across different agencies and modes.</p>
<p>The data pre-processing step was necessary to clean the data, put it in a consistent format, preparing it for further analysis.</p>

<p>The VRM, or Vehicle Revenue Miles, represents the total distance traveled by vehicles in revenue service.</p>
<p>The analysis starts with aggregating the VRM values for each transit agency, grouping the data by Agency, and finally summing the total VRM for each group, or agency. Any missing values are excluded from the grouping, through the na.rm = TRUE statement. The results are then arranged in descending order, with the agency with the highest total VRM as the top row.</p>
<p>The results show MTA NYC Transit to have the highest total VRM, with over 10.8B revenue miles. This tells us the MTA NYC Transit system is the most extensive when viewed with the lens of # of miles covered.</p>

<p>Next, the study continues in performing exploratory data analysis. The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.</p>
<p>Below, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.</p>
<p>The code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.</p>

<p>The table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.</p>
<p>Below is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.</p>
<p>We find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022. This is a drop in subway ridership by about 34%.</p>

<p>The analysis below explores the ridership efficiency of the different NYC transit modes. Efficiency is measured as the average number of Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM), which indicates how effectively each mode transports passengers against the distance covered.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Looking at the table above, the following may be concluded. The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request.</p>

<p>In the task below, a comprehensive dataset is created via merging annual transit usage and financial data for 2022.</p>
<p>First, the USAGE table is filtered on the year 2022, then aggregated each UPT and VRM for each transit agency and mode of transportation. This summarized data is stored in the new table titled USAGE_2022_ANNUAL.</p>
<p>Then, the FINANCIALS table is updated to match the Mode labels in USAGE. Once again, the abbreviations are changed to their full names. This standardizes the Mode naming convention.</p>
<p>Lastly, the USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table is merged with the updated FINANCIALS table, joined on NTD ID and Mode. The new table is titled USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS. This table becomes very useful when evaluating farebox recovery in the following section.</p>
