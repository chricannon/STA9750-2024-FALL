    "text": "Abstract: This report analyzes data from the National Transit Database. The report explores some of the fiscal characteristics of major US public transportation systems, such as: farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source. One key metric to keep in mind is the farebox recovery ratio. Farebox recovery ratio represents the proportion of operating expenses that are covered just by fares alone. The ratio is total fares/total operating expenses for said time frame. This ratio becomes important as we explore various cities, their agencies for public transportation, and their different modes of public transportation and look for the most efficient and profitable form.\n\n\nThis study uses three primary datasets: 2022 Fare Revenue, 2022 Operating Expenses, and the latest Monthly Ridership data. A note to keep in mind: because the data is reported on a lag, the 2022 version of each report was used.\nAs you will find in the code below, the three datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged. The fare revenue data was filtered to include only relevant columns and aggregated by the columns NTD ID, Agency Name and Mode. The expenses data was similarly filtered then aggregated by NTD ID and Mode. These two datasets were then merged into a single table titled FINANCIALS.\nThe monthly ridership data was handled separately. The Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) data was extracted and combined into new table titled USAGE. This later allows for an easy calculation of farebox recovery and views of the highest/lowest VRM and UPT across different agencies and modes.\nThe data pre-processing step was necessary to clean the data, put it in a consistent format, preparing it for further analysis.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Downloading, Cleaning, and Joining Tables\n# ============================================================\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\", repos=c(CRAN = \"https://cran.rstudio\"))\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#First snippet of code, provided by professor\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Let's start with Fare Revenue\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx\", \n                destfile=\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nFARES &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\") |&gt;\n  select(-`State/Parent NTD ID`, \n         -`Reporter Type`,\n         -`Reporting Module`,\n         -`TOS`,\n         -`Passenger Paid Fares`,\n         -`Organization Paid Fares`) |&gt;\n  filter(`Expense Type` == \"Funds Earned During Period\") |&gt;\n  select(-`Expense Type`) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`,       # Sum over different `TOS` for the same `Mode`\n           `Agency Name`,  # These are direct operated and sub-contracted \n           `Mode`) |&gt;      # of the same transit modality\n  # Not a big effect in most munis (significant DO\n  # tends to get rid of sub-contractors), but we'll sum\n  # to unify different passenger experiences\n  summarize(`Total Fares` = sum(`Total Fares`)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Next, expenses\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_expenses.csv\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_expenses.csv\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"https://data.transportation.gov/api/views/dkxx-zjd6/rows.csv?date=20231102&accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true\", \n                destfile=\"2022_expenses.csv\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nEXPENSES &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"2022_expenses.csv\") |&gt;\n  select(`NTD ID`, \n         `Agency`,\n         `Total`, \n         `Mode`) |&gt;\n  mutate(`NTD ID` = as.integer(`NTD ID`)) |&gt;\n  rename(Expenses = Total) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`) |&gt;\n  summarize(Expenses = sum(Expenses)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- inner_join(FARES, EXPENSES, join_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`))\n\n#Checking financials data\nhead(FINANCIALS)\n\n#Noticed for some modes, there is an expense value of 0\n#Counting # of rows with 0 expenses\nzero_expenses_count &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0) |&gt;\n  nrow()\nprint(zero_expenses_count) #There are 8 rows with zero expenses\n\n#View rows with zero expenses and print\nzero_expenses_rows &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0)\nprint(zero_expenses_rows)\n\n#Noting as a potential limitation for analysis later in the project.

Any missing values are excluded from the grouping, through the na.rm = TRUE statement. The results are then arranged in descending order, with the agency with the highest total VRM as the top row.\nThe results show MTA NYC Transit to have the highest total VRM, with over 10.8B revenue miles. This tells us the MTA NYC Transit system is the most extensive when viewed with the lens of # of miles covered.\n\n\n\n\n# 2.

To get our data into that granular level, the code, as shown below, filters the Mode to Heavy Rail.\n\n# 3.

The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022.

Efficiency is measured as the average number of Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM), which indicates how effectively each mode transports passengers against the distance covered.\n\n# Additional fact 3\n#MTA NYC Transit ridership efficiency by mode \n#where efficiency represents the avg # of unlinked passenger trips per vehicle revenue mile\nridership_efficiency &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Efficiency = round(sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(VRM, na.rm = TRUE),2))\nprint(ridership_efficiency) #efficiency = for every mile traveled, x# of passengers carried \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Efficiency\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bus                   8.05\n2 Commuter Bus          1.15\n3 Demand Response       0.11\n4 Heavy Rail            6.68\n5 Rapid Bus             9.17\n\n\nLooking at the table above, the following may be concluded. The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request.\n\n\n\nIn the task below, a comprehensive dataset is created via merging annual transit usage and financial data for 2022.\nFirst, the USAGE table is filtered on the year 2022, then aggregated each UPT and VRM for each transit agency and mode of transportation. This summarized data is stored in the new table titled USAGE_2022_ANNUAL.\nThen, the FINANCIALS table is updated to match the Mode labels in USAGE. Once again, the abbreviations are changed to their full names. This standardizes the Mode naming convention.\nLastly, the USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table is merged with the updated FINANCIALS table, joined on NTD ID and Mode. The new table is titled USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS. This table becomes very useful when evaluating farebox recovery in the following section.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 5 - Table Summarization\n# ============================================================\n#creating a new table from USAGE that has annual total (sum) UPT and VRM for 2022\nnames(USAGE)\nUSAGE_2022_ANNUAL &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(year(month) == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, Agency, metro_area, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    UPT = sum(UPT, na.rm=TRUE),\n    VRM = sum(VRM, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Mode = case_when(\n    Mode == \"HR\" ~ \"Heavy Rail\",\n    Mode == \"LR\" ~ \"Light Rail\",\n    Mode == \"YR\" ~ \"Hybrid Rail\",\n    Mode == \"MB\" ~ \"Bus\",\n    Mode == \"DR\" ~ \"Demand Response\",\n    Mode == \"CB\" ~ \"Commuter Bus\",\n    Mode == \"FB\" ~ \"Ferry Boat\",\n    Mode == \"SR\" ~ \"Streetcar\", \n    Mode == \"TB\" ~ \"Trolleybus\",\n    Mode == \"VP\" ~ \"Vanpool\",\n    Mode == \"RB\" ~ \"Rapid Bus\",\n    Mode == \"MG\" ~ \"Monorail\",\n    Mode == \"CR\" ~ \"Commuter Rail\",\n    Mode == \"AR\" ~ \"Alaska Railroad\",\n    Mode == \"TR\" ~ \"Aerial Tramway\",\n    Mode == \"IP\" ~ \"Inclined Plane\",\n    Mode == \"PB\" ~ \"Publico\",\n    Mode == \"CC\" ~ \"Cable Car\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"))  # Default for any unrecognized codes\n\n\n#Merging USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table to the FINANCIALS table \nUSAGE_AND_FINANCIALS &lt;- left_join(USAGE_2022_ANNUAL, \n                                  FINANCIALS, \n                                  join_by(`NTD ID`, Mode)) |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n#Viewing first few rows of merged table \nhead(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor analysis, first the total UPT for each combination of agency and mode is summarized.

We find the MTA NYC Transit with its Heavy Rail mode to have the highest UPT, with ~1.8B unlinked passenger trips in 2022.\n\n\n\nTo reiterate, the Farebox Recovery Ratio is the proportion of operating expenses coverd by fare revenue, and is calculated as the ratio of Total Fares to Expenses. The higher the Farebox Recovery Ratio, the greater financial stability through passenger fare revenue.\n\n# 2.

One caution to keep in mind is this report did not filter on only the major systems, as the programmer chose to include all transportation systems (Major and Minor).\n\n\n\nThe next analysis looks at the lowest operating expenses per UPT, which is an indicator of cost efficiency. The lower the expenses per UPT, the more cost-effective a transportation system is in transporting passengers.\n\n# 3.

This translates to for every mile traveled by the ferry, the system generates over $237 in revenue.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the MTA New York City Transit Heavy Rail Mode is the most efficient transportation system in the country. The subway had $1.8B unlinked trips in 2022 alone. With the highest ridership and UPT, surpassing all other transportation systems in the country, the NYC subway provides the best service efficiency. The scale and service of the MTA NYC Transit system in unparalleled across the country."

    "text": "Next, the study continues in performing exploratory data analysis. The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022.

The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request."

The “null” values are represented as \\N, which R does not recognize as NA values.\nUsing the mutate and the as.numeric commands to change th types of columns.\nStarting with the NAME_BASICS table - taking character columns and converting to numeric, where needed.\n\n\nCode\nNAME_BASICS &lt;- NAME_BASICS |&gt;\n  mutate(birthYear = as.numeric(replace(birthYear, birthYear == \"\\\\N\", NA)),\n         deathYear = as.numeric(replace(deathYear, deathYear == \"\\\\N\", NA)))\n\n\nMoving on to the TITLE_BASICS table. For this one, we adjust two columns from character to numeric. One new fix we are making it taking the isAdult column and converting it from numeric (with values 0 or 1) and converting it to logical (TRUE/FALSE values). This way we will not have to remember how 0 and 1 are defined as TRUE/FALSE values.\n\n\nCode\nTITLE_BASICS &lt;- TITLE_BASICS |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    endYear = as.numeric(replace(endYear, endYear == \"\\\\N\", NA)),\n    runtimeMinutes = as.numeric(replace(runtimeMinutes, runtimeMinutes == \"\\\\N\", NA)),\n    isAdult = as.logical(isAdult) \n  )\n\n\nCleaning the TITLE_EPISODES table.\n\n\nCode\nTITLE_EPISODES &lt;- TITLE_EPISODES |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    seasonNumber = as.numeric(replace(seasonNumber, seasonNumber == \"\\\\N\", NA)),\n    episodeNumber = as.numeric(replace(episodeNumber, episodeNumber == \"\\\\N\", NA))\n  )\n\n\nThe next table to clean would be the TITLE_RATINGS table. The three columns have the correct datatypes so this table is skipped.\nThe writers column in the TITLE_CREW table has several \\N values which need to be replaced with NA. We will maintain the writer column’s type. This is done in the step below.\n\n\nCode\nTITLE_CREW &lt;- TITLE_CREW |&gt;\n    mutate(writers = na_if(writers, \"\\\\N\"))\n\n\nThe last table left for cleaning is the TITLE_PRINCIPALS table.

To do so, we will need to access the TITLE_RATINGS, TITLE_BASICS, and TITLE_EPISODES tables.\nThe code below filters the TITLE_RATINGS table for the episode with a 10/10 rating and at least 200,000 IMDb ratings.\nIt then joins this filtered set of the TITLE_RATINGS table with the TITLE_BASICS table to access the show’s title and series. “tconst” is the unique identifier for the episode’s title we use to join. We use an inner join, so only rows that match in both tables are included.\nThe second inner_join joins the result of the first join to TITLE_EPISODES. This is to be access the series name of the episode.\nThe final inner_join with TITLE_BASICS retrieves the series name by matching the “parentTconst” of the episode to “tconst” of the series in the TITLE_BASICS table.\nWe then use the select function to select only the relevant columns for our dataframe. We finally rename these columns to allow for more descriptive column names.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for episodes with a perfect 10/10 rating and &gt;= 200,000 votes\nperfect_episode &lt;- TITLE_RATINGS |&gt;\n  filter(averageRating == 10, numVotes &gt;= 200000) |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    TITLE_BASICS |&gt; filter(titleType == \"tvEpisode\"), \n    by = \"tconst\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  inner_join(TITLE_EPISODES, by = \"tconst\") |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    TITLE_BASICS |&gt; filter(titleType == \"tvSeries\"), \n    by = c(\"parentTconst\" = \"tconst\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(primaryTitle.x, primaryTitle.y, titleType.x, averageRating, numVotes)\n\n# Rename the columns for better understanding \nperfect_episode &lt;- perfect_episode |&gt;\n  rename(\n    episodeTitle = primaryTitle.x,\n    seriesTitle = primaryTitle.y,\n    episodeType = titleType.x\n  )\n\n\nThe below code creates a summary table of our results.\n\nCode\n# Create the summary table with gt\nperfect_episode_tb &lt;- perfect_episode |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Highly Rated TV Episode\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    episodeTitle = \"Episode Title\",\n    seriesTitle = \"Series Title\",\n    episodeType = \"Type\",\n    averageRating = \"Rating\",\n    numVotes = \"# Votes\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(averageRating, numVotes),\n    decimals = 0\n  )\n\n# Display the table\nprint(perfect_episode_tb)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly Rated TV Episode\n\n\n\n\nEpisode Title\n\n\nSeries Title\n\n\nType\n\n\nRating\n\n\n# Votes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOzymandias\n\n\nBreaking Bad\n\n\ntvEpisode\n\n\n10\n\n\n227,589\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find the TV episode with a perfect 10/10 rating and at least 200,000 IMDb ratings is the episode titled “Ozymandias” in the “Breaking Bad” series.\nMoving on to learning more about the actor Mark Hamill. The code below finds the 4 most popular projects Mark Hamill worked on. The code filters the NAME_BASICS table to only Mark Hamill, then splits the knownForTitles columns into separate rows for each title, then joins to the TITLE_BASICS table to get project details. We then arrange the numVotes in descending order and take the top 4 using a slice function. We select the title and type for the final output of his projects.\n\nCode\n# Step 1: Find the four projects Mark Hamill is most known for using a join\nmark_hamill_projects &lt;- NAME_BASICS |&gt;\n  filter(primaryName == \"Mark Hamill\") |&gt;\n  separate_rows(knownForTitles, sep = \",\") |&gt;\n  inner_join(TITLE_BASICS, by = c(\"knownForTitles\" = \"tconst\")) |&gt;\n  select(primaryTitle, titleType)\n\n# Step 2: Create a gt table to display the four projects\nmark_hamill_projects_tb &lt;- mark_hamill_projects |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Mark Hamill's Most Known Projects\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    primaryTitle = \"Project Title\",\n    titleType = \"Type\"\n  )\n\n# Display the table\nmark_hamill_projects_tb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Hamill's Most Known Projects\n\n\nProject Title\nType\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\nmovie\n\n\nStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi\nmovie\n\n\nStar Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\nmovie\n\n\nStar Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\nmovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we move on to answer the next question of: What TV series, with more than 12 episodes, has the highest average rating? (Q5)\nFirst, we filter the TITLE_BASICS table to only get TV series:\n\n\nCode\ntv_series &lt;- TITLE_BASICS |&gt;\n  filter(titleType == \"tvSeries\")\n\n\nThen, filter the TITLE_EPISODES table to be grouped by series and filtered on series with more than 12 episodes:\n\n\nCode\nseries_episodes_filtered &lt;- TITLE_EPISODES |&gt;\n  group_by(parentTconst) |&gt;\n  summarize(numEpisodes = n()) |&gt;\n  filter(numEpisodes &gt; 12)\n\n\nJoining the filtered TITLE_EPISODES table with the TITLE_RATINGS table to calculate average rating by series:\n\n\nCode\nseries_avg_ratings &lt;- series_episodes_filtered |&gt;\n  inner_join(TITLE_RATINGS, by = c(\"parentTconst\" = \"tconst\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(parentTconst) |&gt;\n  summarize(avgRating = mean(averageRating, na.rm = TRUE), numEpisodes = first(numEpisodes)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avgRating)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) #series with highest avg rating\n\n\nJoining the series with the highest average rating back with TITLE_BASICS to access the series name:\n\n\nCode\nhighest_rated_series &lt;- series_avg_ratings |&gt;\n  inner_join(tv_series, by = c(\"parentTconst\" = \"tconst\")) |&gt;\n  select(primaryTitle, avgRating, numEpisodes)\n\n\nCreating a table to display the results from the 4 steps of code above:\n\nCode\nhighest_rated_series_tb &lt;- highest_rated_series |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Highest Rated TV Series with More Than 12 Episodes\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    primaryTitle = \"Series Title\",\n    avgRating = \"Average Rating\",\n    numEpisodes = \"Number of Episodes\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(avgRating),\n    decimals = 1\n  )\n\n#displaying table \nhighest_rated_series_tb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Rated TV Series with More Than 12 Episodes\n\n\nSeries Title\nAverage Rating\nNumber of Episodes\n\n\n\n\nCraft Games\n9.7\n318\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on to the final question of Task 2, regarding the TV series Happy Days (1974-1984) (Q6)\nFirst, filtering to get only the “Happy Days” TV series from the TITLE_BASICS table.\n\n\nCode\nhappy_days_series &lt;- TITLE_BASICS |&gt;\n  filter(primaryTitle == \"Happy Days\" & titleType == \"tvSeries\")\n\n\nNext, joining with TITLE_EPISODES to get episode data for “Happy Days”.\n\n\nCode\nhappy_days_episodes &lt;- TITLE_EPISODES |&gt; \n  inner_join(happy_days_series, by =  c(\"parentTconst\" = \"tconst\"))\n\n\nPerforming another join with TITLE_RATINGS to get the ratings for each Happy Days episode.\n\n\nCode\nhappy_days_ratings &lt;- happy_days_episodes |&gt;\n  inner_join(TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\")\n\n\nGrouping by season and calculating the average rating for each season.\n\n\nCode\nhappy_days_avg_ratings &lt;- happy_days_ratings |&gt;\n  group_by(seasonNumber) |&gt;\n  summarize(avgRating = mean(averageRating, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nFor this question, a bar chart will be a great way to visualize our results.

    "text": "Abstract: This report analyzes data from the National Transit Database. The report explores some of the fiscal characteristics of major US public transportation systems, such as: farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source. One key metric to keep in mind is the farebox recovery ratio. Farebox recovery ratio represents the proportion of operating expenses that are covered just by fares alone. The ratio is total fares/total operating expenses for said time frame. This ratio becomes important as we explore various cities, their agencies for public transportation, and their different modes of public transportation and look for the most efficient and profitable form.\n\n\nThis study uses three primary datasets: 2022 Fare Revenue, 2022 Operating Expenses, and the latest Monthly Ridership data. A note to keep in mind: because the data is reported on a lag, the 2022 version of each report was used.\nAs you will find in the code below, the three datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged. The fare revenue data was filtered to include only relevant columns and aggregated by the columns NTD ID, Agency Name and Mode. The expenses data was similarly filtered then aggregated by NTD ID and Mode. These two datasets were then merged into a single table titled FINANCIALS.\nThe monthly ridership data was handled separately. The Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) data was extracted and combined into new table titled USAGE. This later allows for an easy calculation of farebox recovery and views of the highest/lowest VRM and UPT across different agencies and modes.\nThe data pre-processing step was necessary to clean the data, put it in a consistent format, preparing it for further analysis.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Downloading, Cleaning, and Joining Tables\n# ============================================================\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\", repos=c(CRAN = \"https://cran.rstudio\"))\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#First snippet of code, provided by professor\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Let's start with Fare Revenue\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx\", \n                destfile=\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nFARES &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\") |&gt;\n  select(-`State/Parent NTD ID`, \n         -`Reporter Type`,\n         -`Reporting Module`,\n         -`TOS`,\n         -`Passenger Paid Fares`,\n         -`Organization Paid Fares`) |&gt;\n  filter(`Expense Type` == \"Funds Earned During Period\") |&gt;\n  select(-`Expense Type`) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`,       # Sum over different `TOS` for the same `Mode`\n           `Agency Name`,  # These are direct operated and sub-contracted \n           `Mode`) |&gt;      # of the same transit modality\n  # Not a big effect in most munis (significant DO\n  # tends to get rid of sub-contractors), but we'll sum\n  # to unify different passenger experiences\n  summarize(`Total Fares` = sum(`Total Fares`)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Next, expenses\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_expenses.csv\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_expenses.csv\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"https://data.transportation.gov/api/views/dkxx-zjd6/rows.csv?date=20231102&accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true\", \n                destfile=\"2022_expenses.csv\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nEXPENSES &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"2022_expenses.csv\") |&gt;\n  select(`NTD ID`, \n         `Agency`,\n         `Total`, \n         `Mode`) |&gt;\n  mutate(`NTD ID` = as.integer(`NTD ID`)) |&gt;\n  rename(Expenses = Total) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`) |&gt;\n  summarize(Expenses = sum(Expenses)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- inner_join(FARES, EXPENSES, join_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`))\n\n#Checking financials data\nhead(FINANCIALS)\n\n#Noticed for some modes, there is an expense value of 0\n#Counting # of rows with 0 expenses\nzero_expenses_count &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0) |&gt;\n  nrow()\nprint(zero_expenses_count) #There are 8 rows with zero expenses\n\n#View rows with zero expenses and print\nzero_expenses_rows &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0)\nprint(zero_expenses_rows)\n\n#Noting as a potential limitation for analysis later in the project.

The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022. This is a drop in subway ridership by about 34%.\n\n# Additional fact 2 - Comparing NYC ridership pre and post pandemic \n#pre-pandemic \npre_pandemic_ridership &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\",\n         month &gt;= \"2019-01-01\",\n         month &lt;= \"2019-12-31\") |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_ridership = mean(UPT, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nprint(pre_pandemic_ridership)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_ridership\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     57709634.\n\n#post-pandemic \npost_pandemic_ridership &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\",\n         month &gt;= \"2022-01-01\",\n         month &lt;= \"2022-12-31\") |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_ridership = mean(UPT, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nprint(post_pandemic_ridership)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_ridership\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     37980885.\n\nprint(paste(\"The average ridership for the year of 2019, pre-pandemic, was \", round(pre_pandemic_ridership,0), \" and the average ridership for the year of 2022, post pandemic, was \", round(post_pandemic_ridership,0)))\n\n[1] \"The average ridership for the year of 2019, pre-pandemic, was  57709634  and the average ridership for the year of 2022, post pandemic, was  37980885\"\n\nround((1 - post_pandemic_ridership/pre_pandemic_ridership) * 100,0)\n\n  avg_ridership\n1            34\n\n\nThe analysis below explores the ridership efficiency of the different NYC transit modes. Efficiency is measured as the average number of Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM), which indicates how effectively each mode transports passengers against the distance covered.\n\n# Additional fact 3\n#MTA NYC Transit ridership efficiency by mode \n#where efficiency represents the avg # of unlinked passenger trips per vehicle revenue mile\nridership_efficiency &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Efficiency = round(sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(VRM, na.rm = TRUE),2))\nprint(ridership_efficiency) #efficiency = for every mile traveled, x# of passengers carried \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Efficiency\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bus                   8.05\n2 Commuter Bus          1.15\n3 Demand Response       0.11\n4 Heavy Rail            6.68\n5 Rapid Bus             9.17\n\n\nLooking at the table above, the following may be concluded. The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request.\n\n\n\nIn the task below, a comprehensive dataset is created via merging annual transit usage and financial data for 2022.\nFirst, the USAGE table is filtered on the year 2022, then aggregated each UPT and VRM for each transit agency and mode of transportation. This summarized data is stored in the new table titled USAGE_2022_ANNUAL.\nThen, the FINANCIALS table is updated to match the Mode labels in USAGE. Once again, the abbreviations are changed to their full names. This standardizes the Mode naming convention.\nLastly, the USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table is merged with the updated FINANCIALS table, joined on NTD ID and Mode. The new table is titled USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS. This table becomes very useful when evaluating farebox recovery in the following section.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 5 - Table Summarization\n# ============================================================\n#creating a new table from USAGE that has annual total (sum) UPT and VRM for 2022\nnames(USAGE)\nUSAGE_2022_ANNUAL &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(year(month) == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, Agency, metro_area, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    UPT = sum(UPT, na.rm=TRUE),\n    VRM = sum(VRM, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Mode = case_when(\n    Mode == \"HR\" ~ \"Heavy Rail\",\n    Mode == \"LR\" ~ \"Light Rail\",\n    Mode == \"YR\" ~ \"Hybrid Rail\",\n    Mode == \"MB\" ~ \"Bus\",\n    Mode == \"DR\" ~ \"Demand Response\",\n    Mode == \"CB\" ~ \"Commuter Bus\",\n    Mode == \"FB\" ~ \"Ferry Boat\",\n    Mode == \"SR\" ~ \"Streetcar\", \n    Mode == \"TB\" ~ \"Trolleybus\",\n    Mode == \"VP\" ~ \"Vanpool\",\n    Mode == \"RB\" ~ \"Rapid Bus\",\n    Mode == \"MG\" ~ \"Monorail\",\n    Mode == \"CR\" ~ \"Commuter Rail\",\n    Mode == \"AR\" ~ \"Alaska Railroad\",\n    Mode == \"TR\" ~ \"Aerial Tramway\",\n    Mode == \"IP\" ~ \"Inclined Plane\",\n    Mode == \"PB\" ~ \"Publico\",\n    Mode == \"CC\" ~ \"Cable Car\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"))  # Default for any unrecognized codes\n\n\n#Merging USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table to the FINANCIALS table \nUSAGE_AND_FINANCIALS &lt;- left_join(USAGE_2022_ANNUAL, \n                                  FINANCIALS, \n                                  join_by(`NTD ID`, Mode)) |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n#Viewing first few rows of merged table \nhead(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor analysis, first the total UPT for each combination of agency and mode is summarized.

This translates to for every mile traveled by the ferry, the system generates over $237 in revenue.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the MTA New York City Transit Heavy Rail Mode is the most efficient transportation system in the country. The subway had $1.8B unlinked trips in 2022 alone. With the highest ridership and UPT, surpassing all other transportation systems in the country, the NYC subway provides the best service efficiency. The scale and service of the MTA NYC Transit system in unparalleled across the country."

    "text": "Next, the study continues in performing exploratory data analysis. The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022.

The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request."

Which transit system (agency and mode) had the highest farebox recovery, defined as the highest ratio of Total Fares to Expenses?\nhighest_farebox_recovery &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Farebox_Recovery = `Total Fares` / Expenses) |&gt;\n  filter(Farebox_Recovery == max(Farebox_Recovery, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Farebox_Recovery)) |&gt;\n  head(1) #returns top row\n#print(highest_farebox_recovery)\nmost_farebox_agency &lt;- highest_farebox_recovery$Agency\nmost_farebox_mode &lt;- highest_farebox_recovery$Mode\ntop_recovery &lt;- highest_farebox_recovery$Farebox_Recovery\n\nprint(paste(\"The Agency with the highest Farebox Recovery is\", most_farebox_agency, \"and its mode is\", most_farebox_mode, \"with a farebox recovery ratio of\", round(top_recovery,2)))\n\n[1] \"The Agency with the highest Farebox Recovery is Transit Authority of Central Kentucky and its mode is Vanpool with a farebox recovery ratio of 2.38\"\n\n\nThe Vanpool mode of transportation within the Transit Authority of Central Kentucky performed with the highest farebox recovery ratio. One caution to keep in mind is this report did not filter on only the major systems, as the programmer chose to include all transportation systems (Major and Minor).\n\n\n\nThe next analysis looks at the lowest operating expenses per UPT, which is an indicator of cost efficiency. The lower the expenses per UPT, the more cost-effective a transportation system is in transporting passengers.\n\n# 3.

This is another important metric in evaluating cost efficiency. In this case, we look at cost efficiency in relation to the distance covered by transit services.\n\n# 5. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per VRM?\n#very similar to code for #3 \nlowest_expenses_per_VRM &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Expenses_per_VRM = Expenses / VRM) |&gt;\n  arrange(Expenses_per_VRM) |&gt;\n  head(1)\n\nlowest_exp_VRM_agency &lt;- lowest_expenses_per_VRM$Agency\nlowest_exp_VRM_mode &lt;- lowest_expenses_per_VRM$Mode\nlowest_exp_per_VRM_amt &lt;- lowest_expenses_per_VRM$Expenses_per_VRM\n\nprint(paste(\"The transit system with the lowest expenses per VRM is\", lowest_exp_VRM_agency, \"and its mode is\", lowest_exp_VRM_mode, \"with an expenses per VRM ratio of\", round(lowest_exp_per_VRM_amt,2)))\n\n[1] \"The transit system with the lowest expenses per VRM is New Mexico Department of Transportation and its mode is Vanpool with an expenses per VRM ratio of 0.34\"\n\n\nThe output above tells us the New Mexico Department of Transportation, when operating the Vanpool mode, has the lowest expenses per VRM, at $0.34 per mile. This portrays the efficient use of resources within this mode and agency.\n\n\n\n\n# 6. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per VRM?\n# very similar to code for #4\nhighest_fares_per_VRM &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Fares_per_VRM = `Total Fares` / VRM) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Fares_per_VRM)) |&gt;\n  head(1)\n\nhighest_fares_agency &lt;- highest_fares_per_VRM$Agency\nhighest_fares_mode &lt;- highest_fares_per_VRM$Mode\nhighest_fares_per_VRM_amt &lt;- highest_fares_per_VRM$Fares_per_VRM\n\nprint(paste(\"The transit system with the highest total fares per VRM is\", highest_fares_agency,\"and its mode is\", highest_fares_mode, \"with a fares per VRM ratio of\", round(highest_fares_per_VRM_amt,2)))\n\n[1] \"The transit system with the highest total fares per VRM is Chicago Water Taxi (Wendella) and its mode is Ferry Boat with a fares per VRM ratio of 237.46\"\n\n\nWe find the Chicago Water Taxi has the highest fares per VRM, at ~$237. This translates to for every mile traveled by the ferry, the system generates over $237 in revenue.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the MTA New York City Transit Heavy Rail Mode is the most efficient transportation system in the country. The subway had $1.8B unlinked trips in 2022 alone. With the highest ridership and UPT, surpassing all other transportation systems in the country, the NYC subway provides the best service efficiency. The scale and service of the MTA NYC Transit system in unparalleled across the country."
