    "text": "Abstract: This report analyzes data from the National Transit Database. The report explores some of the fiscal characteristics of major US public transportation systems, such as: farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source. One key metric to keep in mind is the farebox recovery ratio. Farebox recovery ratio represents the proportion of operating expenses that are covered just by fares alone. The ratio is total fares/total operating expenses for said time frame. This ratio becomes important as we explore various cities, their agencies for public transportation, and their different modes of public transportation and look for the most efficient and profitable form.\n\n\nThis study uses three primary datasets: 2022 Fare Revenue, 2022 Operating Expenses, and the latest Monthly Ridership data. A note to keep in mind: because the data is reported on a lag, the 2022 version of each report was used.\nAs you will find in the code below, the three datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged. The fare revenue data was filtered to include only relevant columns and aggregated by the columns NTD ID, Agency Name and Mode. The expenses data was similarly filtered then aggregated by NTD ID and Mode. These two datasets were then merged into a single table titled FINANCIALS.\nThe monthly ridership data was handled separately. The Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) data was extracted and combined into new table titled USAGE. This later allows for an easy calculation of farebox recovery and views of the highest/lowest VRM and UPT across different agencies and modes.\nThe data pre-processing step was necessary to clean the data, put it in a consistent format, preparing it for further analysis.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Downloading, Cleaning, and Joining Tables\n# ============================================================\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\", repos=c(CRAN = \"https://cran.rstudio\"))\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#First snippet of code, provided by professor\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Let's start with Fare Revenue\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx\", \n                destfile=\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nFARES &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"2022_fare_revenue.xlsx\") |&gt;\n  select(-`State/Parent NTD ID`, \n         -`Reporter Type`,\n         -`Reporting Module`,\n         -`TOS`,\n         -`Passenger Paid Fares`,\n         -`Organization Paid Fares`) |&gt;\n  filter(`Expense Type` == \"Funds Earned During Period\") |&gt;\n  select(-`Expense Type`) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`,       # Sum over different `TOS` for the same `Mode`\n           `Agency Name`,  # These are direct operated and sub-contracted \n           `Mode`) |&gt;      # of the same transit modality\n  # Not a big effect in most munis (significant DO\n  # tends to get rid of sub-contractors), but we'll sum\n  # to unify different passenger experiences\n  summarize(`Total Fares` = sum(`Total Fares`)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Next, expenses\nif(!file.exists(\"2022_expenses.csv\")){\n  # This should work _in theory_ but in practice it's still a bit finicky\n  # If it doesn't work for you, download this file 'by hand' in your\n  # browser and save it as \"2022_expenses.csv\" in your project\n  # directory.\n  download.file(\"https://data.transportation.gov/api/views/dkxx-zjd6/rows.csv?date=20231102&accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true\", \n                destfile=\"2022_expenses.csv\", \n                quiet=FALSE, \n                method=\"wget\")\n}\nEXPENSES &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"2022_expenses.csv\") |&gt;\n  select(`NTD ID`, \n         `Agency`,\n         `Total`, \n         `Mode`) |&gt;\n  mutate(`NTD ID` = as.integer(`NTD ID`)) |&gt;\n  rename(Expenses = Total) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`) |&gt;\n  summarize(Expenses = sum(Expenses)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- inner_join(FARES, EXPENSES, join_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`))\n\n#Checking financials data\nhead(FINANCIALS)\n\n#Noticed for some modes, there is an expense value of 0\n#Counting # of rows with 0 expenses\nzero_expenses_count &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0) |&gt;\n  nrow()\nprint(zero_expenses_count) #There are 8 rows with zero expenses\n\n#View rows with zero expenses and print\nzero_expenses_rows &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  filter(Expenses == 0)\nprint(zero_expenses_rows)\n\n#Noting as a potential limitation for analysis later in the project.

Any missing values are excluded from the grouping, through the na.rm = TRUE statement. The results are then arranged in descending order, with the agency with the highest total VRM as the top row.\nThe results show MTA NYC Transit to have the highest total VRM, with over 10.8B revenue miles. This tells us the MTA NYC Transit system is the most extensive when viewed with the lens of # of miles covered.\n\n\n\n\n# 2.

To get our data into that granular level, the code, as shown below, filters the Mode to Heavy Rail.\n\n# 3.

The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022.

Efficiency is measured as the average number of Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM), which indicates how effectively each mode transports passengers against the distance covered.\n\n# Additional fact 3\n#MTA NYC Transit ridership efficiency by mode \n#where efficiency represents the avg # of unlinked passenger trips per vehicle revenue mile\nridership_efficiency &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Efficiency = round(sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(VRM, na.rm = TRUE),2))\nprint(ridership_efficiency) #efficiency = for every mile traveled, x# of passengers carried \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Efficiency\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bus                   8.05\n2 Commuter Bus          1.15\n3 Demand Response       0.11\n4 Heavy Rail            6.68\n5 Rapid Bus             9.17\n\n\nLooking at the table above, the following may be concluded. The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request.\n\n\n\nIn the task below, a comprehensive dataset is created via merging annual transit usage and financial data for 2022.\nFirst, the USAGE table is filtered on the year 2022, then aggregated each UPT and VRM for each transit agency and mode of transportation. This summarized data is stored in the new table titled USAGE_2022_ANNUAL.\nThen, the FINANCIALS table is updated to match the Mode labels in USAGE. Once again, the abbreviations are changed to their full names. This standardizes the Mode naming convention.\nLastly, the USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table is merged with the updated FINANCIALS table, joined on NTD ID and Mode. The new table is titled USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS. This table becomes very useful when evaluating farebox recovery in the following section.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 5 - Table Summarization\n# ============================================================\n#creating a new table from USAGE that has annual total (sum) UPT and VRM for 2022\nnames(USAGE)\nUSAGE_2022_ANNUAL &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(year(month) == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`, Agency, metro_area, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    UPT = sum(UPT, na.rm=TRUE),\n    VRM = sum(VRM, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nFINANCIALS &lt;- FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  mutate(Mode = case_when(\n    Mode == \"HR\" ~ \"Heavy Rail\",\n    Mode == \"LR\" ~ \"Light Rail\",\n    Mode == \"YR\" ~ \"Hybrid Rail\",\n    Mode == \"MB\" ~ \"Bus\",\n    Mode == \"DR\" ~ \"Demand Response\",\n    Mode == \"CB\" ~ \"Commuter Bus\",\n    Mode == \"FB\" ~ \"Ferry Boat\",\n    Mode == \"SR\" ~ \"Streetcar\", \n    Mode == \"TB\" ~ \"Trolleybus\",\n    Mode == \"VP\" ~ \"Vanpool\",\n    Mode == \"RB\" ~ \"Rapid Bus\",\n    Mode == \"MG\" ~ \"Monorail\",\n    Mode == \"CR\" ~ \"Commuter Rail\",\n    Mode == \"AR\" ~ \"Alaska Railroad\",\n    Mode == \"TR\" ~ \"Aerial Tramway\",\n    Mode == \"IP\" ~ \"Inclined Plane\",\n    Mode == \"PB\" ~ \"Publico\",\n    Mode == \"CC\" ~ \"Cable Car\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"))  # Default for any unrecognized codes\n\n\n#Merging USAGE_2022_ANNUAL table to the FINANCIALS table \nUSAGE_AND_FINANCIALS &lt;- left_join(USAGE_2022_ANNUAL, \n                                  FINANCIALS, \n                                  join_by(`NTD ID`, Mode)) |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n#Viewing first few rows of merged table \nhead(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor analysis, first the total UPT for each combination of agency and mode is summarized.

We find the MTA NYC Transit with its Heavy Rail mode to have the highest UPT, with ~1.8B unlinked passenger trips in 2022.\n\n\n\nTo reiterate, the Farebox Recovery Ratio is the proportion of operating expenses coverd by fare revenue, and is calculated as the ratio of Total Fares to Expenses. The higher the Farebox Recovery Ratio, the greater financial stability through passenger fare revenue.\n\n# 2.

One caution to keep in mind is this report did not filter on only the major systems, as the programmer chose to include all transportation systems (Major and Minor).\n\n\n\nThe next analysis looks at the lowest operating expenses per UPT, which is an indicator of cost efficiency. The lower the expenses per UPT, the more cost-effective a transportation system is in transporting passengers.\n\n# 3.

This translates to for every mile traveled by the ferry, the system generates over $237 in revenue.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the MTA New York City Transit Heavy Rail Mode is the most efficient transportation system in the country. The subway had $1.8B unlinked trips in 2022 alone. With the highest ridership and UPT, surpassing all other transportation systems in the country, the NYC subway provides the best service efficiency. The scale and service of the MTA NYC Transit system in unparalleled across the country."

    "text": "Next, the study continues in performing exploratory data analysis. The theme of this analysis is uncovering additional insights about the MTA New York City Transit system.\nBelow, we explore NYC ridership across different transit modes. First, the focus is on breaking down the total ridership for each mode of transit available via MTA New York City Transit. The code first filters on MTA NYC Transit, groups by Mode and sums the Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) for each.\nThe code reveals certain modes are much more used compared to others. In NYC, the subway, or heavy rail, surpasses all other modes of transportation. One can imagine how frequently riders use the NYC subway when commuting.\n\n# ============================================================\n# Task 4 - Explore and Analyze\n# ============================================================\n\n# Three more interesting transit facts \n# Additional fact 1 - ridership for each mode by MTA NYC Transit \nmta_ridership_by_mode &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  filter(Agency == \"MTA New York City Transit\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Mode) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Ridership = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Ridership)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Total_Ridership = comma(Total_Ridership, accuracy =1))\n\nprint(mta_ridership_by_mode) #table outlining different modes of transportation and their total rides \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Mode            Total_Ridership\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 Heavy Rail      51,672,094,135 \n2 Bus             16,889,723,939 \n3 Rapid Bus       315,432,467    \n4 Commuter Bus    133,304,773    \n5 Demand Response 91,175,466     \n\n\nThe table above provides a readable summary of the study - one can clearly see the Heavy Rail has the highest Total Ridership, followed by the Bus.\nBelow is another analysis of the MTA NYC Transit system - comparing subway ridership pre and post pandemic. The data is segmented into two time periods: the year of 2019 (1/1/19 - 12/31/19) for pre-pandemic and the year of 2022 (1/1/22 - 12/31/22) for post pandemic.\nWe find the average monthly ridership decreased by nearly 20M trips/per month from 2019 to 2022.

The Rapid Bus it the most efficient mode of transport in NYC. With an efficiency score of 9.17, this translates into the Rapid Bus carrying over 9 passengers per mile traveled.\nNot surprisingly, the Demand Response as the lowest efficiency at 0.11. Demand Response modes of transportation are typically used for specialized transportation needs and are available upon request."

The subway had $1.8B unlinked trips in 2022 alone. With the highest ridership and UPT, surpassing all other transportation systems in the country, the NYC subway provides the best service efficiency. The scale and service of the MTA NYC Transit system in unparalleled across the country."
